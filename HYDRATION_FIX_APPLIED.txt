I have fixed the "hydation error" (<a> descendant of <a>) by removing the extra <Link> wrappers in:
1. `app/(site)/destination/DestinationList.tsx`
2. `app/(site)/tips/page.tsx`

The `DestinationCard` and `TipsCard` components already handle the links internally, so the outer links were redundant and caused invalid HTML.

You should now be able to view the pages without errors.
